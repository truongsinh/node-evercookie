# Evercookie Middleware for Connect/Express JS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/truongsinh/node-evercookie.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/truongsinh/node-evercookie)

[Express](http://expressjs.com) is a sinatra inspired web development framework for node.js, insanely fast, flexible, and simple.
[Evercookie](http://samy.pl/evercookie/) is a Javascript API that produces extremely persistent cookies in a browser.
It is written in JavaScript and additionally uses a SWF (Flash) object for the Local Shared Objects and,
originally, PHPs for the server-side generation of cached PNGs and ETags.

This middleware port original PHP script to Connect/Express JS

# Node version support
- 6
- 8
- 10
- 11

# Express version support:
- 4.x
- 5.x

# Install
```bash
npm install --save evercookie
```

# Usage
Evercookie backend middleware needs cookie, thus `cookieParser()` middleware must come before Evercookie backend middleware.
In addition, express server must serve front end assets, such as index.html and evercookie.js as well.
```js
var express = require('express');
var evercookie = require('evercookie');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser')

var app = express();
app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(evercookie.backend());
app.use(express.cookieParser());
app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public')); // be careful, you may want to use path.join instead!
```

# Settings
Customized settings can be used, but up to this moment, it makes no sense to change the dafault one,
as all these values are hardcoded in (frontend) `evercookie.js`.
```js
//...
app.use(evercookie.backend({
  pngCookieName: 'evercookie_png',
  etagCookieName: 'evercookie_etag',
  cacheCookieName: 'evercookie_cache',
  pngPath: '/evercookie_png.php',
  etagPath: '/evercookie_etag.php',
  cachePath: '/evercookie_cache.php'
}));
//...
```

# Test
```bash
npm test
```
